<h1>Captain Anshuman Singh’s parents want Army's 'next of kin' policy revised. What is it?</h1>
<p>Why Captain Anshuman Singh Was Awarded The Kirti Chakra
  
    On July 19, 2023, a short circuit caused the fire incident. Spotting a fibreglass hut engulfed in flames, Captain Singh immediately acted to save those trapped inside. He rescued five individuals but the fire soon spread to the nearby medical investigation room.
    
    Captain Singh went back into the fire and was trapped inside while trying to retrieve some life-saving drugs.
    
    Despite his best efforts, he could not escape the blaze and died inside.
    
    Captain Anshuman Singh was cremated with full state honour at his native place in Uttar Pradesh's Deoria district on July 22, 2023.
    
    Anshuman Singh met Smriti Singh on the first day of their engineering college before he was selected for the Indian Army.
    
    Capt Singh married Smriti in February last year after graduating from Armed Forces Medical College, Pune. After two months of marriage, he was deputed in Operation Meghdoot at Siachen Glacier Area.
    
    "We met at an engineering college but then he got selected in a medical college. Super intelligent guy. From then on, after just one month of meeting, it was a long-distance relationship for eight long y</p>

<h1>NEET UG 2024 Hearing highlights: CBI arrests accused Rakesh Ranjan from Bihar</h1>
<p>NEET UG 2024 Hearing Live Updates: A Supreme Court bench led by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud on Thursday deferred the hearing on a bunch of petitions concerning the alleged paper leak in the NEET UG medical entrance examination to July 18.  The bench was hearing the matter that included petitions alleging irregularities and malpractices during the May 5 test and seeking a re-test of the exam. 

    The matter was adjourned as the CJI-led bench noted that some of the parties haven't received the affidavits filed by the Centre and National Testing Agency (NTA) and that they need to apply their minds to the responses before arguments. The other two judges on the bench are Justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra.</p>

<h1>Delhi court extends Arvind Kejriwal’s judicial custody in case registered by CBI</h1>
<p>Delhi's Rouse Avenue court extended the judicial custody of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal until July 25 in a case registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against him in the excise policy case.

    The court order comes hours after the Supreme Court granted the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convenor an interim bail. Kejriwal, 55, was arrested by the CBI on June 26 while remaining in judicial custody in the ED case against him. 
    
    The CBI has accused Kejriwal of being ‘one of the main conspirators’ in the irregularities linked to the now-scrapped Delhi excise policy. In the Delhi court, the agency had alleged that former media in-charge of AAP Vijay Nair, a close associate of Kejriwal, was in touch with various liquor manufacturers and trades and demanded undue gratification since March 2021, for incorporation of provisions favourable to them in the excise policy.
    
    In its previous chargesheet, the CBI had claimed that out of ₹100 crore kickbacks received by AAP, an amount of ₹44.45 crore was transferred to Goa during June 2021 to January 2022 via ‘hawala channels’, and was used for AAP's assembly poll campaign in the coastal state.

    <h1>PCB urged to treat Shaheen Afridi, Naseem Shah like Jasprit Bumrah by Pakistan coach Jason Gillespie </h1>
    <p> The past few months have been a whirlwind for Pakistan cricket. There have been a series of disappointments for the side, starting from a poor ODI World Cup last year, where it finished fifth, which immediately followed Babar Azam's resignation from captaincy. While Shaheen Afridi was named the new captain in limited-overs formats, he, too, was removed following a 1-4 series defeat to New Zealand earlier this year.</p>

    <h1>Evening briefing: Cong reacts to 'Samvidhan Hatya Diwas'; Mamata govt moves SC against West Bengal governor; more news
    </h1>
    <p>In a sharp reaction to the Centre's decision to observe June 25 as the Samvidhaan Hatya Diwas, the Congress on Friday said June 4 should be observed as “ModiMukti Diwas” because it marked the moral defeat of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In the Lok Sabha elections whose results were declared on June 4, the BJP could win only 240 seats, falling short of a simple majority by 32 seats. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, however, formed his third successive government with the support of his NDA allies. The Opposition's INDIA bloc said the loss of seats was a moral defeat of PM Modi</p>
